# HomeZada Partner API

Welcome to the HomeZada Partner Integration API documentation. You can use our API to access HomeZada API endpoints, which can get information on various Accounts and Properties in your partner store.

We have language bindings in Shell and Ruby. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

For questions about this API, or for help in setting up a new Partner account, please email us [here](mailto:info@homezada.com).

<aside class="success">
Remember — all data via this API is scoped by the Properties or Accounts only associated with your partner id. No other data is accessible.
</aside>

# JSON API

> A simple JSON API example call:

```shell
# Simple example of reading a Partner owned property
curl -i 
-H "Accept: application/vnntent-Type:application/vnd.api+json' 
--user your-partner-id:your-partner-api-secret 
https://secure.homezada.com/api/v1/properties/123456
```

```ruby

  require "net/http"
  require "uri"
  require "json"

  HOMEZADA_PARTNER_API_URL = "https://secure.homezada.com/api/v1/properties/123456"
  uri = URI.parse(HOMEZADA_PARTNER_API_URL)
  http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
  http.use_ssl = true if uri.scheme == 'https'
  request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri.request_uri)
  request.basic_auth(PARTNER_ID, PARTNER_API_SECRET)
  
  response = http.request(request)
  result = JSON.parse(response.body) if response.code == '200'
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

The HomeZada APIs are built around the concepts of the JSON API specification. The API supports creating, updating, deleting, and fetching resources and relationships via HTTPS verbs. More info on the JSON API specification can be found at [https://jsonapi.org/](https://jsonapi.org/).


# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Versioning

The API is versioned and can be access from the following root address per version:

`/api/v1`

Staging and API sandbox data can be accessed via

[https://staging.homezada.com/api/v1](https://staging.homezada.com/api/v1)

The production data can be accessed via

[https://secure.homezada.com/api/v1](https://secure.homezada.com/api/v1)


# Users

A User is a regular HomeZada consumer account. When created via this API it will be associated with the Partner id automatically.
